    title: 'Moderna ‚Äì Vaccine Lifecycle Tracking Application',

    description: `At Moderna, I was part of a two-person development team responsible for designing and building a web application that scientists used to track the lifecycle of vaccines. This was a high-stakes, data-heavy application, and while functionality was critical, creating an intuitive, visually clear, and user-friendly interface was just as important.<br/><br/>

üí° <span style="font-weight: bold;">Our Design Process</span><br/>
We approached the project as a combination of UI/UX design and development. Our workflow included:<br/>
1. Collaborating with end users to understand their workflows and pain points.<br/>
2. Designing interactive prototypes that illustrated layouts, flows, and visual hierarchy.<br/>
3. Testing prototypes with users and iterating to improve usability and clarity.<br/>
4. Translating prototypes into functional interfaces with polished visual design.<br/><br/>

üé® <span style="font-weight: bold;">UI/UX Focus</span><br/>
A core part of my role was designing the interface with the end user in mind:<br/>
- <span style="font-weight: 550;">User-centered design:</span> Ensuring that every element, from typography to spacing to button placement, made the application intuitive for scientists, many of whom were not familiar with digital tools.<br/>
- <span style="font-weight: 550;">Visual hierarchy:</span> Organizing information so critical data was immediately clear, while less essential details were visually secondary.<br/>
- <span style="font-weight: 550;">Consistency and branding:</span> Aligning the UI with Moderna‚Äôs design scheme while maintaining nearly full creative control over layout, colors, and component styling.<br/>
- <span style="font-weight: 550;">Accessibility:</span> Designing interfaces that were easy to navigate and readable for all users, regardless of technical comfort.<br/><br/>

üñ•Ô∏è <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bringing Design to Life</span><br/>
I handled both UI design and front-end implementation, ensuring that the visual language we created translated directly into functional, responsive components. This included:<br/>
- Designing reusable components that maintained consistency across the application.<br/>
- Implementing interactions and flows that enhanced usability without compromising performance.<br/>
- Balancing aesthetic polish with the practical needs of users who relied on the application daily.<br/><br/>

üöÄ <span style="font-weight: bold;">Outcome & Takeaways</span><br/>
Through this project, I gained first-hand experience designing interfaces for complex, user-critical applications. I learned how to:<br/>
- Think like the end user to create intuitive, elegant interfaces.<br/>
- Merge design thinking with front-end development for cohesive UI/UX.<br/>
- Prioritize usability and clarity while maintaining creative freedom.<br/>
- Translate user feedback into concrete design improvements that enhance workflow efficiency.<br/><br/>

This project reinforced my passion for <span style="font-weight: 550;">UI/UX design</span>, particularly in building interfaces that are not just functional but also enjoyable, clear, and human-centered.`,
